""" 
Both yield and return will return some value from a function.

The difference is that while a return statement terminates a
function entirely, yield statement pauses the function saving
all its states and later continues from there on successive calls.



One interesting thing to note is that the value
of variable n is remembered between each call *(website example).

Unlike normal functions, the local variables are not destroyed when the function yields.

"""Methods like __iter__() and __next__() are implemented automatically. 
SOOOO we can iterate through the items using      <next()>.

StopIteration is raised automatically on further calls."""


# ⭐ WAY 1: Activating the Generator ⭐

# to iterate that function, after that we used the explicit "next" command
# to access the Generator saved inside of "var".

They have lazy execution ( producing items only when asked for ). For this reason,
 a generator expression is much more memory efficient than an equivalent list comprehension.

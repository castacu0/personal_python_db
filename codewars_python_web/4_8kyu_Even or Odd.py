#1st

#2nd 👑 Clever
def even_or_odd(number):
  return ["Even", "Odd"][number % 2]
        #There's an array, consisting of two strings, "Even" and "Odd".
        #The first one thefore has index of 0 and the second has index of 1.
        #number % 2 is 1 for odd numbers and 0 for even numbers.
        #Therefore this expression return the string "Even"
        # for even numbers and "Odd" for odd numbers."""
